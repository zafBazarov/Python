## Data Visualization Overview


# Value of data visualization

# ***Data visualization*** is all about communicating results from data. 

# It's about simplifying data, cleaning data with the end goal of helping you, and your stakeholders understand data on a more intuitive level. To bring this to life, I want to give you an example. 
# Data visualization: 
# - Simplifying Data
# - Cleaning data
# - Understanding data

# Suppose you take out a loan, and you're given a payment table like this. When you look at this, what you really want to do is find out how much you're paying interest over time. 
# picture

#Now, this table is not really a great way to see this data. Instead, we might look to create a visualization like this. And as you can see, you actually pay more interest at the beginning of a loan, and this wouldn't have been clear if we didn't see this graph. 

#Another way to look at this is by using a visualization like we see here. It's easy to see. The longer the term the loan, the more you end up paying an interest overall.

# And just like that, data visualizations can be really powerful, and that's a reason why you should use visualizations in your day-to-day work.

# Leverage programming languages

``There are a lot of great reasons to use a programming language like Python to build data visualizations. ``

First, there are a lot of different types of visualizations you can make, including boxplots, bar graphs, line graphs, histograms, et cetera. 
Second, using a programming language to build the data visualization allows you to quickly iterate and improve on a visualization, as well as try out many different visualizations. Why Python for data Visualization? 
- Many types of visualizations
  + Boxplots
  + Bar graphs
  + Line graphs
  + Histograms
- Codinga Data Visulization
  + You to quickly iterate
  + Imporove ona visulization
  + Try out any different visualizations

To get you started, I want you to first understand a data visualization process. You first have to have data, where you clean it, you simplify it, and sometimes even augment your data source if your data source is not rich enough. 
From there, you can use that understanding from your visualization to improve your data quality or to explore other aspects of your data, and this process can keep on going until you have a visualization that tells a compelling story. 

So there are a few common tools and libraries in Python to build data visualizations. Next, there are two major plotting libraries in Python, Matplotlib and Seaborn. And lastly, we'll go over the NumPy and Pandas libraries, as before you can visualize data, you have to get it, you have to clean it, and sometimes even augment it, and NumPy and Pandas help you do it. 

***Python has a solid claim to be the fastest-growing major programming language.***

Data visualization projects require many different packages and libraries.  
``Before we can plot data, we first need data in a portable form. ``

NumPy and Pandas can be used to efficiently load, store, manipulate, and export in memory data.
***NumPY and Pandas***
- Load
- Stoare
- Manipulate
- Export

Pandas can also be used as a wrapper for Matplotlib, which brings us to Matplotlib and Seaborn. They're very popular Python plotting libraries. Matplotlib's API is relatively low-level. 
This allows for a lot of customization, but also a lot of code. A way around this is to utilize a Seaborn wrapper, which offers high-level graphics and integrates well with Pandas' library. 
It's also important to keep in mind that with every Matplotlib wrapper like Seaborn is still often useful to dive into Matplotlib's syntax to adjust the final plot output. And that's it. 
These are a couple common tools you can use to build data visualizations.

***Matplotlib and Seaborn***
- Very popular python plotting libraries
- Matplotlib's API is elatively low-level
- Seaborn wrapper offers high-level graphics
- Adjust the final plot output with Matplotlib's syntax.
