## Data Visualization Overview


# Value of data visualization

# ***Data visualization*** is all about communicating results from data. 

# It's about simplifying data, cleaning data with the end goal of helping you, and your stakeholders understand data on a more intuitive level. To bring this to life, I want to give you an example. 
# Data visualization: 
# - Simplifying Data
# - Cleaning data
# - Understanding data

# Suppose you take out a loan, and you're given a payment table like this. When you look at this, what you really want to do is find out how much you're paying interest over time. 
# picture

#Now, this table is not really a great way to see this data. Instead, we might look to create a visualization like this. And as you can see, you actually pay more interest at the beginning of a loan, and this wouldn't have been clear if we didn't see this graph. 

#Another way to look at this is by using a visualization like we see here. It's easy to see. The longer the term the loan, the more you end up paying an interest overall.

# And just like that, data visualizations can be really powerful, and that's a reason why you should use visualizations in your day-to-day work.
